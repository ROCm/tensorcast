# Attention

> TODO(ericd): *this needs to be written*

TensorCast has a configuration interface and a quantization interface intended to make
experimentation with Triton fused attention kernels nas simple and powerful as possible.

There is some information about the configuration [here](./api.md#configuration), and a presentation about
the Low Precision Attention tensorcast project [here](./slides.md).  The current status of that project
can be found [here](../tests/status.md#attention).
