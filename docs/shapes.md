# Tensor Shapes

Tensor shapes, and their accompanying scale, metadata, and sparsity mask shapes, are somewhat complicated.
There are compressed (packed) shapes; shapes that are temporary to aid in scale discovery and sparsity, shapes
targeted to specific checkpoint storage or backend-specific ordering; and probably more.  This document spells out
the details.

Complexity comes into play in the dimension along which the scale tile or sparsity tile exists, with codebook
subtiles, and particularly with two dimensional tiles.  As seen in the [scaling documentation](./scale.md),
a vector tile may be along any dimension in the tensor (defaulting to the last dimension).  Matrix tiles
must have adjacent dimensions.

Padding is another nuance that is mainly used for performing casts using PyTorch ops.

## Compression

In order to benefit from the storage and data movement advantages of small storage datatypes, they need to be
compressed (say, into 4 bits instead of fake quantized to 16 or 32 bits).  TensorCast manages this through the
`tcast.Tensor` wrapper than include tensor data, the datatype, scales, and other metadata.  The tensors within
this wrapper are:

* tensor (data)
* scale (float or exponent scale factors)
* zero (float or int zero point offset for asymetrical int-quantized data
* meta (metadata, currently limited to use in codebook datatypes)
* mask (sparsity mask for tile-scaled structural sparsity)

Each of these tensors has a shape and a torch.dtype for uncompressed and compressed versions.  In some cases,
the compressed and uncompressed versions have the same shape but a different torch.dtype.

## Tensor

The tensor that holds the actual weight/activation/gradient maintains its original shape and torch dtype in uncompressed,
unquantized form. It can be reshaped prior to the cast call, however, to make it easier for the datatype's scale dimension(s)
to be defined and applied.  If the scale dimension has a stride of 1, the process should be faster.

Compression is another thing.  A 4 bit datatype can be packed into 8 bit elements; an MXFP8/6/4 can be stored in
`torch.float8_e4m3fn` (or `torch.float8_e5m2`) with an an exponent scale.  The shape remains the same unless packed.  The
torch dtype may change.  Sparsity introduces the opportunity for compression while increasing the scale tile size proportionally
to the sparsity level.  TensorCast aims for good compression while maintaining alignments that are conducive to fast
compression and decompression kernels.

## Scale and Zero Point

The uncompressed scale tensor has a shape based on the data tensor, but with the scale dimension(s) being divided by the
tile size in the dimension(s).  The compressed shape is the same unless multiple values are packed into a single tensor element.
In that case, the scale dimension is further reduced.  For matrix scale tiles, only one of the two dimensions is reduced in
size for the packing.

The zero tensor has the same uncompressed shape as the scale tensor, but may have a different torch dtype.  The compressed
zero point may contain more than one value per `torch.uint8`, thus may differ from the compressed scale shape if it does not
have the same packing ratio.

## Meta

Metadata is currently specific to codebooks, and can be per tile or per subtile.  The uncompressed shape for tiles
is the same as the scale shape.  For subtile codebooks, the scaled dimension is multiplied by the number of subtiles in each
tile in the appropriate dimension(s).

Compression of metadata is a bit more complex.  Since PyTorch does not support unsigned int tensors larger than uint8, metadata
is always `torch.uint8` (who wants two's complement getting involved).  The limit on meta bits per subtile is 8, so in the
worst case the compressed shape would be the same as the uncompressed shape.  Otherwise the bits will be packed into
`(meta_bits * num_subtiles + 7) // 8` bytes, and the scale dimension will be that number times the number of tiles.

## Mask

The uncompressed sparsity mask is the same shape as the uncompressed data tensor, but it's type is `torch.bool`.  Since
BoolTensor is 8 bits per value, the compressed sparse dimension will be the uncompressed size divided by 8.

Note that the compressed data tensor is reduced in size in the sparse dimension depending on the ratio of dense values to
the sparse tile size (within reasonable alignment).  A two of eight sparsity would result in a compressed data tensor reduced
by a factor of four in the sparse dimension, yet the compressed mask is only reduced by the packing.

> Matrix (2D) sparsity is not supported. There are two challenges here.  One is that a 2D mask has to have the same number of dense values in both axes, which a limiting constraint.  The other is that you can't compress in two axes.
