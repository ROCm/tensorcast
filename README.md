# TensorCast (tcast)

> THIS IS THE V3 BRANCH OF TENSORCAST which is just now starting to be populated (3/3/25).

TensorCast is an open source PyTorch casting/quantization library in early development.
It is based on PyTorch 2.4+.

Why do we need yet another quantization library?  Most people will not.  TensorCast exists for
the purpose of exploring alternative scaling strategies and adaptive datatypes, to enable
researchers to provide evidence-based proposals for enhancing GEMM accelerator hardware.

The scope of TensorCast is defining datatypes and converting tensors from one datatype to another.
While unscaled, tensor-scaled, and channel-scaled datatypes are supported, the emphasis is on
tile-scaled datatypes such as the OCP MX datatypes ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10537.pdf),
[spec](https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-microscaling-formats-mx-v1-0-spec-final-pdf))
and storage datatypes.

We attempt to keep things simple, but the high degree of customization can introduce complexity
at times.  We welcome feedback (and direct contribution) that will help us improve this package.
